## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Report ports a box doesn't have with an error naming the box, rather than placing them outside it or dividing by zero.
- Report wire ends that aren't on a side with an error, rather than drawing a stray curve.
- Report port counts that aren't four, such as `box=2`, with an error, rather than a runaway argument or a silently wrong count.
